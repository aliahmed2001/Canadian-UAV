Hello!

For this mini-assignment I used Python 3 with jupyter notebook. To be exact I used Python version: 3.8.8 and pandas version: 1.2.4

I used the pandas libray from python in my code. I used it to read the CSV and JSON files.

To run the python files click on the "Cell" tab on the top of the jupyter notebook and then click "run all". I have already attached the solution files for all three problems, these files were created from running my python code.


Thanks for reading!
